# Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling.

Example repository [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify-examples/tree/main/laravel).

## Requirements

- Set `Build Pack` to `nixpacks`
- Set `APP_KEY`
- Set `Ports Exposes` to `80` 
- 
:::tip
If you configured your application before version beta.184 and set the `NIXPACKS_PHP_ROOT_DIR` and `NIXPACKS_PHP_FALLBACK_PATH` environment variables, you need to remove them.
:::

### Other components
If you application needs a database or redis, you can simply create them before in the Coolify's dashboard.

You will get the connection strings which you can use in your application.
