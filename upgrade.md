# Upgrade

By default Coolify upgrades itself automatically. You can turn it off in the `Settings` menu.

## Manually Upgrade

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

Or if you prefer to use a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash -s 4.0.0-beta.154
```
